## Question 1

## Create dataframe

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1234)
question1_df = tibble(
  vec.numeric = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec.logical = c(vec.numeric > 2),
  vec.char = c("My", "name", "is", "Anu", "and", "this", "is", "my", "homework", "attempt"),
  vec.factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male"))
)
```
```{R}
## Try taking the mean of the each variable in the dataframe
## ## 
mean (question1_df$vec.numeric)
## mean = 2.446132
## this was able to work because we are just taking the means of numeric values 
mean (question1_df$vec.logical)
## mean 0.7
## this was able to work because things labelled as True were counted as 1 and False were counted as 2, then the mean was taken of these numeric values. 
mean (question1_df$vec.char)
## Mean = N/a
## We are unable to take a mean of this variable because it is not numeric or logical 
mean (question1_df$vec.factor)
## Mean = N/a
## We are unable to take a mean of this variable because it is not numeric or logical 
```

```{r results = 'hide'}
## Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables (show chunk but not output)
as.numeric(question1_df$vec.logical)
as.numeric(question1_df$vec.char)
as.numeric(question1_df$vec.factor)

## By applying the as.numeric function to the logical variable, the entries that should be false are made a 0 and the ones that should be a true are made a 1.
## By applying the as.numeric function to the character variable, the entries were all turned into NA.
## By applying the as.numeric function to the factor variable, the entries that should be male are made a 2 and the ones that should be a woman are made a 1. 
```

```{R}
## Write a second code chunk and covert your character variable from character to factor to numeric and convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric 

as.numeric(as.factor(question1_df$vec.char))
## This code turned the character words each into a factor (so it assigned each word a factor) then each factor was given a number when it got convered to numeric. 
as.numeric(as.character(question1_df$vec.factor))
## This code simply produced NAs for all the entries as the factors were unable to be converted to characters. 
```
