question1_df = tibble(
  vec.numeric = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec.logical = c(vec.numeric > 2),
  vec.char = c("My", "name", "is", "Anu", "and", "this", "is", "my", "homework", "attempt"),

)
```

``` r
## Try taking the mean of the each variable in the dataframe
## ## 
mean (question1_df$vec.numeric)
```

    ## [1] 2.446132

``` r
## mean = 2.446132
## this was able to work because we are just taking the means of numeric values 
mean (question1_df$vec.logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
## mean 0.7
## this was able to work because things labelled as True were counted as 1 and False were counted as 2, then the mean was taken of these numeric values. 
mean (question1_df$vec.char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(question1_df$vec.char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
## Mean = N/a
## We are unable to take a mean of this variable because it is not numeric or logical 
mean (question1_df$vec.factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(question1_df$vec.factor): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
## Mean = N/a
## We are unable to take a mean of this variable because it is not numeric or logical 
```
